# PyrePi
This is a simple python script using Pyrebase to interface with a Raspberry Pi.

If you have a Raspberry Pi project you would like to control from the internet, you can use this simple script to control the GPIO pins.
Using the Firebase Realtime Database, you can either manipulate values in the console or create a website through which you interact.
